1 - Split dataset(non standardized) into test and train

In all the below mentioned steps, replace the test data with the values from train data.
Ex: median in the train set used to fill missing values should be used in test as well.

Convert Data to Correct Data Types
Missing Values, Duplicates
Draw graphs
(Check histograms)Remove outliers and skew check

--Standradization of dataset

Correlations between Features and Target
Feature selection - RFECV, Variance_Check, Category_freq_chk
Feature extraction - PCA etc


to avoid data leakage missing value check, skew, standardization have to be re-done on test and train
standardize test and train 


t-test - 1- to compare means of sample and population
         2 -  to compare means of 2 samples
ex: exit polls - ( to compare means of sample and population)
